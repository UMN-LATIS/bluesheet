# CLA Groups Tool

The CLA Groups Tool is an easy way to track membership in committees, departments, or anywhere else in which you need to maintain a list of people and their role.  In addition to current membership, the tool tracks historical membership, so you can ask questions like "Who was the chair of our faculty advisory group two years ago?".  The Groups Tool also allows you to query information how many groups a person is currently participating in, so you know whether it's safe to ask them to join another one.  

## Gaining Access

Anyone with a University of Minnesota Internet ID has access to the groups tool.  By logging in, you'll see which groups you're currently a member of.  

### Group Management Access

In order to create groups or browse existing groups, you need to be granted elevated privileges.  As we're currently in development on this tool, those permissions are site-wide.  We may move to a more granular structure in the future, based on feedback from our users.  For now, to request the ability to create and manage groups, just [send us an email](mailto:mcfa0086@umn.edu).

## Creating a Group

If you've got the appropriate permissions, you can create a group by clicking "create a group" in the navbar. You'll be asked to enter a name, select a [parent organization](/#adding-organizations), and a group type.  If you'd like another group type added, please [send us an email](mailto:mcfa0086@umn.edu).

## Group Settings

After creating a group, you can click "Edit Group" to adjust some additional settings. You can change the group name, organization or type. 

### Show Unit Checkbox

The "Show Unit" checkbox will include members' organizational unit in the list of members.  If all of your members are from one organization, you can turn this off to remove some clutter.

### Artifacts

Artifacts provide you a way to add arbitrary links to your group.  For example, you can link to the group's team drive, charter document, or shared calendar.  Each artifact gets a title and a link.  **You must click save after adding artifacts**

## Adding Members

After adding a group, you can add members.  Click on "edit group" and then click "add member". You can either enter a name to look someone up, or enter their internetId (x500) or email address.  You can bulk-add people using a comma-separated list of email addresses or internetIds.  Even if these lists include other information (names, etc), the groups tool will automatically find the email addresses with in a list. 

You can also assign a role when adding a member.  The dropdown shows commonly used roles, but you can type to add your own.  **Every member must be assigned a role.**

**After adding members, you must click the "save" button.**

## Editing Membership

Membership can be edited at any time.  To remove a member from a group, click the trash icon.  This will remove their current membership, but you'll always be able to see historical membership data with the "include previous members" checkbox. You can also edit the member's participation dates - for example, if you'd like to add historical data, you can backdate membership.  

The notes field can be used to capture any extra data - for example, a reminder of which cohort someone is a member of. 

**After editing members, you must click the "save" button.**

## Deactivating a group

When a group is deactivated, all of the current members are marked as inactive.  The group is not deleted though, so it will still be available for historical purposes, and membership can still be accessed.  This is a good way to retire a group that is no longer functioning.

## Browsing Groups

The "Browse Groups" link in the header allows you to navigate through existing groups, or filter by organizational hierarchy. 

## Adding organizations

Organizations provide a way to "group groups", based on College or other high-level organization.  Parent Organizations don't have their own memberships, they're just folders that hold other groups.  To request that a new parent organization be added, please [send us an email](mailto:mcfa0086@umn.edu).
