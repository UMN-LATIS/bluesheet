# Welcome to the CLA Groups Tool

The CLA Groups Tool provides a way to track the members of the various groups, committees, taskforces and departments. It tracks the roles that people have within those groups, and keeps track of historical membership. It can be used to answer questions like "Who are all the Directors of Undergraduate Studies" or "Who chaired our Fun Committee three year ago?".

## Who can use the Groups Tool?

Anyone with an Internet ID has access to view their own group membership and to browse the other groups within the system. In order to make changes, you need to be marked as the administrator for a given group, or you need to request administrative access to the tool. [Email us](mailto:latistecharch@umn.edu) for that access</a>.

## Who updates groups?
This can vary from group to group. In academic departments, the Departmental Admin is usually responsible for maintaining the department's entry in the Groups Tool. Anyone flagged as group administrator will get periodic (twice per year) email reminders to update their groups.

## I want to add a new group - where should it go?
The groups tool has a folder structure, which can be used to make it easier to find groups. You can also create sub-groups - for example, if you have a committee that sets up a sub-committee to tackle a specific project.

Folders are created by administrators of the groups tool - if you've got an idea for a new folders, [let us know](mailto:latistecharch@umn.edu). Similarly, get in touch if you'd like to consult on the location for a new group.
