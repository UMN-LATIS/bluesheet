## Gaining Access

Anyone with a University of Minnesota Internet ID has access to BlueSheet.  By logging in, you'll see which groups you're currently a member of.  

### Group Management Access

In order to create groups or browse existing groups, you need to be granted elevated privileges.  As we're currently in development on this tool, those permissions are site-wide.  We may move to a more granular structure in the future, based on feedback from our users.  For now, to request the ability to create and manage groups, just [send us an email](mailto:latistecharch@umn.edu).

## Creating a Group

If you've got the appropriate permissions, you can create a group by clicking "create a group" in the navigation bar. You'll be asked to enter a name, select a [folder](/#adding-organizations), and a group type.  If you'd like additional folders added, please [send us an email](mailto:latistecharch@umn.edu).


## Group Settings

After creating a group, you can click "Edit Group" to adjust some additional settings. You can change the group name, organization or type. 

### Abbreviation
We love acronyms and abbreviations.  You can add the abbreviation for a group in this field. 

### Folder
Folders are ways to organize groups, to aid with browsing and exploration.

### Parent Group

The "parent group" is a way to specify that this group is a sub-group or sub-committee.  For example, if you've got working groups that split off from a primary group to accomplish a task, you might use this feature to keep track of them. 

### Show Unit Checkbox

The "Show Unit" checkbox will include members' organizational unit in the list of members.  If all of your members are from one organization, you can turn this off to remove some clutter.

### Google Group Name
If this group has a Google Group, you can add that info here. 

### Group Notes

Add additional descriptive information about the group. 

### Artifacts

Artifacts provide you a way to add arbitrary links to your group.  For example, you can link to the group's website, team drive, charter document, or shared calendar.  Each artifact gets a title and a link.  **You must click save after adding artifacts**

## Adding Members

After adding a group, you can add members.  Click on "edit group" and then click "add member". You can either enter a name to look someone up, or enter their internetId (x500) or email address.  You can bulk-add people using a comma-separated list of email addresses or internetIds.  Even if these lists include other information (names, etc), BlueSheet will automatically find the email addresses with in a list. 

You can also assign a role when adding a member.  The dropdown shows commonly used roles, but you can type to add your own.  **Every member must be assigned a role.**

**After adding members, you must click the "save" button.**

### Roles

BlueSheet automatically suggests commonly used roles, but you can type anything you want into the role field.  

### Member options

If you're adding a "department", BlueSheet will show a list of "official roles" for departments.  These are just reminders for you, and aren't required.

You can set both start and end dates.  End dates can be in the future as well - BlueSheet will automatically remove users when the date passes. 

## Editing Membership

Membership can be edited at any time.  To remove a member from a group, click the red icon of the person with the minus sign.  This will remove their current membership, but you'll always be able to see historical membership data with the "include previous members" checkbox. You can also edit the member's participation dates - for example, if you'd like to add historical data, you can backdate membership.  

The notes field can be used to capture any extra data - for example, a reminder of which cohort someone is a member of. 

**After editing members, you must click the "save" button.**

## Deactivating a group

When a group is deactivated, all of the current members are marked as inactive.  The group is not deleted though, so it will still be available for historical purposes, and membership can still be accessed.  This is a good way to retire a group that is no longer functioning.

## Favorites


## Browsing Groups

The "Browse Groups" link in the header allows you to navigate through existing groups, or filter by folder hierarchy. 

## Browsing Roles

The "Browse Roles" link allows you to see all of the people who have been tagged with a given role. You can use this to generate email lists or spreadsheets for all of the people in a given role. 

## Adding folders

Folders provide a way to "group groups", based on College or other high-level organization.  Folders don't have their own memberships, they just hold other groups.  To request that a new folder be added, please [send us an email](mailto:latistecharch@umn.edu).
